#Fastfetch + Kitty

I've been interested in Neofetch for a while.  This year it got retired and Fastfetch seems to be the leading replacement.  I finally got images to work with Fastfetch -- in the Kitty terminal emulator.  

So I created this repo to store themes that combine config for Fastfetch and Kitty.
